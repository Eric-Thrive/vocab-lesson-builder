The lion looked powerful and brave as it walked around. Then I spotted a tall giraffe eating leaves from a tree. The giraffe's long neck helped it reach the highest branches. A zebra ran past with its black and white stripes shining in the sun. Finally, a playful monkey swung from branch to branch, making everyone laugh. What an adventure!"
