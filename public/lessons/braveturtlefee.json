His friend, Maya, told him there was a small **fee** to join. \"A **fee**?\" Leo worried. \"What if I don't have enough money?\" Maya said, \"Don't worry, it's a small **fee**.\" The first meeting was at the old pond. The club leader, Mr. Chen, told them they needed to be **brave** explorers. \"Today, we're looking for pond creatures!\" he said. Leo felt a little scared. He saw something moving slowly near the water. It was a small **turtle**! The **turtle** had a green shell. Leo carefully walked closer. He felt **brave** as he watched the **turtle** slowly move into the water. He even took a picture. He knew paying the **fee** was worth it. Being **brave** and seeing the **turtle** made him very happy. He was glad he joined the club."
